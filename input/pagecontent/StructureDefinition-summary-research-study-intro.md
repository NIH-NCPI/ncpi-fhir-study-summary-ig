### Introduction

The NCPI Summary Research Study is used to describe the study itself and to help aggregate the relevant summary results together. 

#### Consent (and other) Groups 

For studies which have logical splits in the data which should be summarized separately of one another, SummaryGroups can be created and referenced by the VariableSummary observations. These should be added to the study's enrollment property.
