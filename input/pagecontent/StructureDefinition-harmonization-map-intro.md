### Introduction

The HarmonizationMap provides a method for "mapping" the variables from the study's data-dictionary to their public ontological terms. The ConceptMap is a FHIR resource designed to translate from one terminology to another. In this case, the source terminology is the data-dictionary and each of the targets are relevant public terms.
